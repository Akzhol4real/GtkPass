# GtkPass
A password generator with GTK-based graphical user interface.

## Introduction

## Compiling & Installation

This project is based on the good old _autotools_. Therefore for compiling and installing the software you only need the commands:

```
./autogen.sh
cd build
../configure
make
make install
```

There are a few requirements your system has to meet in order to successfully build the project. I developed and tested the program on Linux only, so there may be problems building on Windows. You will definitely need the following libraries and their respective development headers installed on your system:

 - libsodium (for secure random numbers)
 - libgtkmm-3.0 (C++ binding for GTK)

The source files contain Doxygen-style comments for automatic generation of a complete source documentation. The documentation can be generated by executing

```
doxygen
```

in the project's root directory.

## Tests

_GtkPass_ includes unit-tests for its core (non-GUI) components. These are written with the dead-simple testing framework `catch`. The test can be executed with

```
make check
```
